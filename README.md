# Car Image Classification

## Overview
This project involves classifying images of cars by make and model using convolutional neural networks

I created a scraper to crawl through a list of car makes and models to get a dataset of 10,000 images that could be used to train the neural network. 

## The Model

I then used a CNN using Keras to build a multi-layer image recognition model that helped to predict the make, model and year of any given image of a car.
